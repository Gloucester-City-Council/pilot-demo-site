# bins2 - Best Practice Simplified Approach

This folder contains an alternative, simplified approach to bin pages following best practices from exemplar UK councils.

## Key Differences from `/Bins/`

### **Problem with `/Bins/` Structure:**

**Too many entry points:**
- `index.html` = Main hub with 6 quick actions + 8 category cards (40+ links)
- `bin-services.html` = Competing hub page for bins & containers

**Result:** Confusing user journey, unclear which page to start from

---

## **bins2 Solution: Clear Hierarchy**

### Single Clear Entry Point

**`index.html` - Simplified Bins Hub**
```
├─ 6 Top Tasks Only (Most Common 80% of User Needs)
│  1. Check your bin day
│  2. What goes in which bin
│  3. Report missed collection
│  4. Order bins & containers
│  5. Garden waste subscription
│  6. Find recycling centre
│
└─ Simple A-Z List ("Browse all bin services")
   └─ 8 services listed alphabetically
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **No competing hubs** - One clear starting point
- ✅ **6 tasks only** - Covers 80% of user needs (Pareto principle)
- ✅ **No category cards** - Removed confusing 8-category navigation
- ✅ **Simple fallback** - A-Z list for less common tasks
- ✅ **Maximum 1-2 clicks** - From home to any task

---

### Refocused Sub-Pages

**`order-bins.html` (was `bin-services.html`)**
- **Clear purpose:** Order/get bins for your property type
- **Not a competing hub:** Clearly a sub-page task
- **User situations maintained:** Still organized by home/flats/developers
- **Title changed:** "Order Bins & Containers" (not "All Your Bins & Containers")

---

## Best Practice Principles Applied

### 1. **Task-Based Not Department-Based** ✅
- Users think "Check my bin day" not "Collection services database"
- Every link is an action verb: Check, Order, Report, Find

### 2. **Maximum 2 Clicks Rule** ✅
```
Home (index.html) → Task Page → Complete
           ↓
   1 click to 80% of tasks
   2 clicks to 100% of tasks
```

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure** ✅
- Show 6 most common tasks prominently
- Hide less common tasks in simple A-Z list
- Prevents cognitive overload

### 4. **Single Source of Truth** ✅
- One bins hub (index.html)
- No duplicate navigation paths
- Clear information architecture

### 5. **Mobile-First Simplicity** ✅
- 6 cards scan faster than 14+ links
- Cleaner, less overwhelming interface
- Better for small screens

## User Journey Examples

### Scenario 1: "I need to check my bin day"
**`/Bins/`:** index.html → Click "Check your bin day" (1 click) ✅
**`/bins2/`:** index.html → Click "Check your bin day" (1 click) ✅

**Winner:** Tie (both 1 click)

---

### Scenario 2: "I'm new to Gloucester, how do I get bins?"
**`/Bins/`:**
- Option A: index.html → "Order bins & containers" quick action → bin-services.html → "New to Gloucester" section (2 clicks)
- Option B: index.html → "Bins and containers" category → "All your bins & containers" link → bin-services.html (2 clicks)
- **Confusion:** Two paths to same destination

**`/bins2/`:**
- index.html → "Order bins & containers" → order-bins.html → "New to Gloucester" section (1 click)

**Winner:** `/bins2/` (clearer path, no confusion)

---

### Scenario 3: "I need assisted collections"
**`/Bins/`:**
- Option A: index.html → Scroll to "Help and support" category → "Assisted bin collections" (2 clicks, requires scrolling past 7 categories)
- Option B: index.html → "Order bins & containers" → bin-services.html → See link in sidebar (2-3 clicks)

**`/bins2/`:**
- index.html → Scroll to "Browse all" A-Z list → "Assisted collections" (1 click, list is visible without scrolling)

**Winner:** `/bins2/` (faster, simpler)
